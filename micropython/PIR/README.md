# HC-SR501 PIR Sensor with LED and buzzer

Build a motion detector that will illuminate the LED and turn on the buzzer.


# For this project you need this:
## Software:
picozero.py - A beginner-friendly library to help you use common electronics components with the Raspberry Pi Pico. 
https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/picozero/blob/master/picozero/picozero.py

## Hardware:
1x LED diode

1x 220 Î© resistor

1x Buzzer

1x HC-SR501 PIR Sensor

and of course Raspberry Pi Pico ;-)

# Let's do this !

First you must connect all. Check image how to do this.
![Schemat](https://github.com/bold663key/rpi-pico/blob/main/micropython/PIR/PIR_LED_and_buzzer.png)

Download all drivers and libraries. Save them into rpi pico.

Use my `PIR.py` code. Now you can run it ! 

You should see that with the detected movement, the LED begins to light up and the buzzer begins to work
