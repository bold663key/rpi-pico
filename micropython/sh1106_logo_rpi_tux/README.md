In this project, you can see how to add images to the SH1106 screen. In this example, I used the Raspberry Pi and Tux logos


# For this project you need this:
## Software:
sh1106.py - Driver for the SH1106 display

## Hardware:
1x Oled display SH1106

and of course Raspberry Pi Pico ;-)

Download all drivers and libraries. Save them into rpi pico.

Use my `sh1106_logo_rpi_tux.py` code. Now you can run it ! 

You should see two logos side by side on the screen
